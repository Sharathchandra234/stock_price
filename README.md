📈 Stock Price Analysis with Google Colab
This repository contains a Google Colab notebook for fetching, analyzing, and visualizing historical stock price data. This project is ideal for financial data analysis, educational purposes, or as a starting point for building a more complex stock prediction model.

🚀 Getting Started
The easiest way to use this project is to open the notebook directly in Google Colab using the badge below.

How to Run the Notebook
Click the "Open In Colab" badge above.

Once in Colab, go to Runtime > Run all to execute the cells sequentially.

Follow the instructions and comments within the notebook (Stock_Price.ipynb) to customize the stock ticker, date ranges, and analysis steps.

📁 Repository Structure
The core of this project is the Jupyter Notebook file:

/
├── Stock_Price.ipynb       # The main Google Colab notebook for stock analysis.
└── README.md               # This file.
✨ Key Features
Based on the nature of the notebook, it likely includes:

Data Retrieval: Automatically fetches real-time and historical stock data from a source like Yahoo Finance using the yfinance library.

Data Visualization: Generates charts (e.g., line plots, candlestick charts) to visualize stock price trends and volumes.

Analysis: (Potential) Includes steps for calculating financial indicators (e.g., Moving Averages, RSI) using pandas.

⚙️ Dependencies
The Colab environment handles most dependencies, but the main Python libraries used in the notebook are:

yfinance

pandas

numpy

matplotlib or plotly (for visualization)

These packages are typically installed via !pip install commands within the first cell of the notebook.
